\begin{abstract}
The SDSS-III: Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) is a 5
year experiment which obtained first light in late 2009. One of the
key goals of the BOSS is to obtain spectra of a sample of
$\sim$150,000 $z>2.2$ quasars, in order to measure baryon acoustic
oscillations (BAO) in the distribution of the \lyaf\ to provide a
percent-level measurement of the expansion history of the Universe.
In this paper, we describe the BOSS quasar target selection algorithms,
and characterize their success, for the first year of BOSS observations
only.  The magnitude limit of the BOSS Year One Quasar survey was set
at $g\leq22.0$ or $r\leq21.85$.  In Year One, the BOSS Quasar Survey
obtained a total of \hbox{54,909} spectra from an area of 878.1
deg$^{2}$ (including $\sim40$~deg$^{2}$ of the SDSS deep stripe
``Stripe 82'') at a mean target density of 62.8 targets deg$^{-2}$.
Of the \hbox{33,556} unique objects with good quality spectra,
\hbox{11,149} had redshifts indicative of stellar spectra, and
\hbox{13,580} we quasars with redshifts of $z\geq2.20$. Over 80\% of
these quasars (\hbox{11,263}) were spectroscopically confirmed for the
first time by the BOSS. The $z\geq2.20$ quasar surface density was
15.46 quasars deg$^{-2}$, with a global efficiency of 26.0\%. However,
in areas targeted at the nominal survey target density of 40 targets
deg$^{-2}$, the efficiency rose to $\sim$35\%, ($\sim$14 $z\geq 2.20$
quasars deg$^{-2}$), with our ``CORE'' selection efficiency being just
over $\sim$50\% ($\sim$10 $z\geq 2.20$ quasars deg$^{-2}$ from 20
targets deg$^{-2}$). Finally, we suggest further methods and new,
non-optical, data that can be utilized, so that as the survey
progresses, BOSS quasar targeting will improve in efficiency.

Martin's point: {\it (i)} If I had 2-3 slides to present on QSOs for students, what would those be??; {\it (ii)} a list of key things a decent student should know (about e.g. QSOs). {\it (iii)} (and from me!) what's the hook/the new thing here... {\it (iv)} from Joanne, summer school notes. 

What this paper is:  
General overview of the current state of observational QSO work. 
Empirical and phenomolgy. 

What this paper is not: 
Detailed review article. 
Heavy on interpretation, or the subtitles on many of the measurements/observations. 
A theoretical work of any sort.

\section{The Luminosity Function} %% (3)
The QLF is defined as the number density of quasars per unit
luminosity. It is often described by a double power-law
\citep[][hereafter, R06]{Boyle00,Croom04,Richards06} of the form
\begin{equation}
  \Phi(L, z) = \frac{ \phi_{*}^{(L)} }
                            {  (L/L^{*})^{\alpha}    +  (L/L^{*})^{\beta}  }
 \ \,
 \label{eq:double_powerlaw}
\end{equation}
with a characteristic, or break, luminosity $L_{*}$.  An alternative
definition of this form of the QLF gives the number density of quasars
per unit magnitude,
\begin{equation}
  \Phi(M, z) = \frac{ \phi_{*}^{(M)} }
       { 10^{0.4{(\alpha +1)[M-M^{*}(z)]}}+10^{0.4{(\beta +1)[M-M^{*}(z) ]}} }
 \label{eq:double_powerlaw_mag}
\end{equation}
The dimensions of $\Phi$ differ in the two conventions.  We have
followed R06 such that $\alpha$ describes the faint end QLF slope, and
$\beta$ the bright end slope.  The $\alpha$/$\beta$ convention in some
other works \citep[e.g.,][]{Croom09b} is in the opposite sense from our 
definition. Evolution of the QLF can be encoded in the redshift dependence 
of the break luminosity, $\phi_{*}$, and also potentially in the evolution of
the power-law slopes.

  \item{PLE}
  \item{Evolution of $M^{*}$ and $\Phi^{*}$}
  \item{Comparison of the QLF at $z=1, 2, 5$ vs. the galaxy LF}
