# Top 100 QSOs
My working repo for the "Top 100 Observables of QSOs" idea that I want to write-up.


## General Idea
I'd like to make a list, with some rank order, of the ``Top 100'' observational 'facts' that we have about luminous AGN, i.e. QSOs, and how this leads to our current understanding of the physics involved in these systems.

My ~Machiavellian motivation here is to show (pre-JWST ;-) that major galaxyy mergers are *not* the primary trigger of the majority of QSO activity (think `knee' of QLF).
